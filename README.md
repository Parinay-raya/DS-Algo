## Overview
The **DS-Algo** project is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science, including sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Features
- üöÄ Implementations of common data structures and algorithms
- üìö Examples and explanations for each algorithm
- ‚úÖ Test cases to validate the correctness of implementations
- üåê Multi-language support for popular programming languages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern code editor (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA)
- Basic knowledge of programming and algorithms
- Git for version control

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
